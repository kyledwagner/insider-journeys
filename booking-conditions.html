                    <hr>
                    <h6 class="text-left text-uppercase">Booking Conditions</h6>
                    <p class="small pb-2">Please read these conditions carefully as they set out the basis upon which we accept all bookings. We reserve the right to amend our booking conditions from time to time. Please check with your travel consultant for our current booking conditions, which are also available on <a href="https://insiderjourneys.com.au">insiderjourneys.com.au</a> before making a booking.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Resonsibility</h5>
                    <p class="small pb-2"><strong>1. </strong>Insider Journeys acts as an agent for the Suppliers (transport, tour, event or accommodation providers) who provide the various goods and/or services (Products). All bookings are subject to the terms and conditions and limitations of liability imposed by each Supplier. It is therefore important for you to obtain and read the applicable Supplier’s terms and conditions as they may limit or exclude their liability to you.</p>
                    <p class="small pb-2">In producing this brochure, we have used information provided by Suppliers. Irrespective of any measures taken by us to ensure the information contained in this brochure is accurate at the time of printing, Insider Journeys disclaims and will be exempt from liability in respect of anything misleading, false, incomplete or inaccurate and any errors, inaccurate description and all associated disappointment, loss, expense, damage, inconvenience, delay, death, shock, illness or injury, however caused.</p>
                    <p class="small pb-2">Insider Journeys does not control the way Products featured within this brochure are provided. Insider Journeys disclaims and will be exempt from liability for anything to do with the supply of such Products. This includes liability (whether as a matter of contract, tort, statute, restitution, or otherwise) for any direct, indirect or consequential loss, liability, claim, cost, expense, proceeding, demand, penalty, disappointment, death, injury, illness, shock, inconvenience or delay. This limitation of liability also applies irrespective of the cause, including negligence of us or a Supplier, withdrawal, cancellation or failure to provide a Product, delay, any variation in the Product, the provision of substitute Products or a change in the Supplier. Without limitation, Insider Journeys will not be responsible if the Product is not available due to inclement weather conditions or other acts of God, civil disturbances, fire, floods, acts of Government or any other authorities, accident to or failure of machinery or equipment or industrial action.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Pricing for Travel Products</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>2. </strong>All pricing is reflected in Australian Dollars unless otherwise specifically denoted and is valid at time of publication but is subject to change. ‘From’ prices represent land only and low season twin share prices (unless otherwise clearly stated). Unless otherwise stated, prices include all government levies and airport taxes as at the date of publication. Dates, itineraries and prices are indicative only. Prices are valid for travel for the date ranges shown subject to the ‘brochure validity’ clause. We will use our reasonable efforts to notify you of changes in prices. The Third-Party Travel Provider may be required to impose surcharges depending on currency fluctuations, surcharges or other variables outside of its control. You acknowledge and agree that you shall be responsible for the prompt payment of all surcharges and price increases. A fee will apply for payments made by debit and credit cards. Please check this fee with us or your travel consultant when booking.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Loyalty Rewards</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>3. </strong>All discounts must be presented at the time of booking and will apply to the basic tour price. Past traveller discounts will be applied once we receive confirmation (previous booking number) that you have previously travelled on an Insider Journeys Small Group Journey. Discounts are not combinable.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Pre-tour registration form</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>4. </strong>You are required to complete a pre-tour registration form before your booking is complete. Third Party Travel Providers may refuse supply if a completed pre-tour registration form is not received. You will receive the pre-tour registration form from either us, the Supplier or your Travel Agent. This form requires you to provide your travel insurance information and no booking can be finalised without this preregistration form being completed.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Deposit & Full Payment</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>5. </strong>A non-refundable deposit of A$200 per person and passenger names as per passport are required 5 days after issuance of an invoice. Additional deposits may be required depending on the policies of the Third-Party Travel Provider. Any additional deposits will be advised at the time of booking or on the invoice. Full payment is due and payable to us 65 days prior to the scheduled date of departure from Australia and will be notified to you in your confirmation of booking.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>6. </strong>We are not responsible for any changes made by a Third-Party Travel Provider to the balance due date and prices are not guaranteed until payment has been made in full and documents have been processed and issued to you. Failure to pay a deposit within 5 days from the date of confirmation or in full by the due date may result in the automatic cancellation of your booking without refund of monies paid, unless you have been unable to complete the booking and pay the balance by the due date, due to our fault.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>7. </strong>Bookings made within 35 days of scheduled departure require full payment on request.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>8. </strong>Payment for domestic flights and regional flights in Asia must be received within 3 days of booking to avoid automatic cancellation by the airline. All bookings are subject to availability at time of booking.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>9. </strong>Groups – a non-refundable deposit of A$500 is due within 5 days of confirmation. Final payment is due 65 days prior to departure.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Cancellation by The Traveller</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>10. </strong>All cancellations must be received by us in writing. No refunds will be made for unused services. Cancellations will be subject to the following cancellation fees applied per person, per confirmed booking:</p>
                    <ol type="a" class="small">
                      <li>cancellations made more than 65 days before the scheduled date for departure from Australia - the deposit</li>

                    </ol>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Changes Made By Us</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>11. </strong>Each year we review and further develop the Travel Products offered. On occasions, we may be required to make changes to certain Travel Products, where deemed necessary by us and the ‘Departure Status Guaranteed’ may not apply to the original itinerary or departure date in those circumstances. If we make a significant change, which is not due to an event beyond our control, you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible before your departure of any significant change and you will be offered the following options:</p>
                    <ol type="a" class="small">
                      <li>Accept a substitute Travel Product (if available). If the substitute Travel Product is of a lower price then you will receive a refund for the price difference between the original Travel Product and substitute Travel Product; or</li>
                      <li>Accept a refund for all monies paid to us “Significant changes” are normally regarded as:</li>
                      <ol type="i">
                        <li>A change affecting the start date of your journey; or</li>
                        <li>A change in the arrival or departure city; or</li>
                        <li>A change in the duration of the itinerary If the significant change is due to force majeure or an event beyond our reasonable control, we will not be liable to offer you any compensation.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </ol>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Hotel Confirmation</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>12. </strong>Due to hotel availability in some destinations the accommodation stated in the tour itinerary may change to that of a similar standard. You will be notified in writing 30 days prior to departure.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Admendments by the traveller</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>13. </strong>Once itineraries are confirmed with deposit on file and provided at the time of amendment the number of passengers on the booked tour is not full, one free amendment is allowed if made 65 days prior to scheduled date of departure.
                    <p class="small">In all other cases, the following amendment fees shall apply:</p>
                    <ol type="a" class="small">
                      <li>50-65 days prior to scheduled date of departure – A$300 per person;</li>
                      <li>50 days or less prior to scheduled date of departure – standard cancellation fees (refer to section 10) will apply and full price will apply to new travel arrangements;</li>
                      <li>If the traveller has utilised their free amendment and they wish to make an amendment more than 65 days prior to the scheduled date of departure and the number of passengers on the booked tour is full – A$200 per booking.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="small"><strong>14. </strong>We will not charge any amendment fees if:</p>
                    <ol type="a" class="small">
                        <li>You amend your booking due to a breach by us of any of our obligations to you or due to our fault; or</li>
                        <li>The Third-Party Travel Provider amends your booking for no fault on your part.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="small"><strong>15. </strong>Notwithstanding clause 13, additional amendment fees may be charged by Third Party Travel Providers such as airlines, hotels or other tour operators in accordance with the terms you agree with the Third-Party Travel Providers (which are separate to our amendment fees). Many Third- Party Travel Providers deem a name change to constitute a cancellation, rather than an amendment and cancellation fees may apply in this instance in accordance with the terms you agree with the Third-Party Travel Provider.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Cancellation & Amendments by Third Party Travel Provider</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>16. </strong>If the Third Party Travel Provider changes any part of your booking for reasons beyond its control, for example, if a Third Party Travel Provider changes its schedules, overbooks, or if there are any changes in applicable surcharges, fees or taxes, we will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you. If any such changes result in your Travel Product costing more or otherwise being materially different, then you may cancel the Travel Product and we will refund any monies already paid less any fees charged by us under these terms and conditions and by the Third Party Travel Providers under the terms and conditions you agreed with them. Please check with your consultant before cancelling or amending a Travel Product in these circumstances as some Third-Party Travel Providers may charge cancellation fees up to 100% of the Travel Product’s price as per their terms and conditions.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Tour Guide</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>17. </strong>An English-speaking Guide will accompany Small Group Journey tours in all destinations.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Maximum Number</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>18. </strong>Escorted Small Group Journeys have a maximum group size of 16 people in all destinations (except Japan which has a maximum group size of 12 people). Guaranteed departures will operate once they have two fully paid travellers booked. You are welcome to contact us for up-to- date passenger numbers prior to departure.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Single Travellers</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>19. </strong>Individuals travelling alone will be required to purchase the single person price for the tour as displayed in the brochure and confirmed by the Insider Journeys Operations team to you or your travel agent.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Shared Rooms & Facilities</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>20. </strong>On all overnight train trips and homestays all travellers will be in shared compartments, even if a single supplement has been paid, due to cabin/room design. On overnight cruises the boats may have other passengers on board and shore excursions and other activities may include other passengers.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Families & Children</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>21. </strong>Bookings are open to people 12 years of age and over. Travellers under 18 will need to either share a room with a parent or another family member or pay the single supplement. Children aged 12-17 (inclusive) must pay the adult price. Triple sharing is usually possible but must be requested at the time of booking. In cases where separate rooms are booked, we will request, but cannot guarantee, interconnecting or adjacent rooms.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Triple Share</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>22. </strong>It is not possible to guarantee triple share rooms. This is because many hotels either do not have triple-bed rooms or have fold-away beds only. Travellers can request a triple room at the time of booking, however, the booking will be confirmed as double/twin plus a fold away bed. During the journey, a triple share may be provided wherever possible, however there are no reductions in price for triple shares.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Minimum Fitness Levels</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>23. </strong>We may require a doctor’s certificate prior to confirmation for any traveller with a pre-existing medical condition or traveller entering their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Please carefully consider the Trip Grading for your tour of interest and choose a Small Group Journey appropriate for your level of health and fitness. You must be able to perform the activities outlined in the ‘Statement of fitness’ section of the ‘Insider Journeys Health Form and Condition of Travel’ and disclose any pre-existing conditions that may affect the normal conduct of the tour and/or enjoyment of other tour members. Final confirmation of a booking is subject to receipt of complete and accurate information about your fitness. If you are concerned about your ability to undertake a Small Group Journey, we can arrange a tailormade itinerary for independent travel as an alternative.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Tour Leader/Local Guide Authority</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>24. </strong>When on the journey, travellers must abide by and comply with the authority and reasonable directions of the Tour Leader, or where applicable the local guide. At all times, the decision of the Tour Leader will be final on matters regarding group dynamics, and individual and group safety and well-being. If a Tour Leader takes the view that you are unable to meet ‘Minimum fitness levels’ the Tour Leader may, at his/her sole reasonable discretion, prevent you from further participation in the journey. Additionally, should you fail to comply with a reasonable decision or direction of the Tour Leader, interfere with the well-being of the group, fail to respect the rights or beliefs of your fellow travellers, or commit an illegal, obscene or otherwise inappropriate act while on journey, the Tour Leader may in his/her reasonable discretion prevent your further participation in the journey. In such instances, we will use our reasonable efforts to assist with onward travel arrangements for the relevant traveller. No refund will be given for any unused portion of the journey in these circumstances.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Travel Insurance</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>25. </strong>It is a condition of travel that all travellers are adequately covered by travel insurance prior to departure. Insurance should cover personal accident and medical expenses, evacuation and repatriation, baggage loss, and cancellation or curtailment of holiday. Your insurance details must be supplied to us at the time of booking. If you fail to provide the requested insurance information prior to travel as well as on arrival in Asia during registration, we reserve the right, acting in our sole discretion, to cancel bookings and apply charges as per our cancellation policy. In some cases, a pre-existing medical condition may not be covered by your travel insurance company.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Travel Documents</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>26. </strong>Travel documents will be issued after final payment has been received. Travel documents may include special conditions including restrictions such as baggage size and weight limits. Travel documents are not transferable. All airline tickets must be issued in the name of the passport holder and some carriers will deny carriage if the name varies and the booking may be cancelled. We have no responsibility for any loss or damage arising from the incorrect entry of a passenger’s name or as a result of the Third-Party Travel Provider’s policies. It is your responsibility to collect all travel documents prior to travel.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Airfares – Cancellations & Amendments</h5>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">River Cruises – Shore Excursions & Water Levels</h5>
                    <p class="small"><strong>28. </strong>The nature of some shore excursions in Asia means that for some excursions there are no formal jetties. While staff are always on hand to assist, those with limited mobility may find these areas difficult to access. Due to the unpredictable nature of weather and its effect on river conditions and water levels, it may on occasions be necessary to complete some elements of the itinerary by land, rather than by boat, or to alter the route of the vessel including substituting some planned stops for others. Such changes can occur at any time without prior notice or warning and no refunds will be given in this instance.</p>

                    <p class="small">Visas, including transit visas, are the passenger’s own responsibility. For more information please log on to: www.dfat.gov.au or www.smartraveller.gov.au. Please check with the respective Embassy or Consulate of each country that you are travelling to, as many destinations require visas for both Australians and non-Australian passport holders. For more information, log on to www.visalink.com.au. You need to ensure that you have at least 6 months validity on your passport from the date of your departure return. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of any health requirements for your travel destinations. Vaccinations are strongly recommended for certain destinations. You need to contact your local doctor who will advise you of these requirements. Please note that vaccinations may be recommended some period in advance of travelling.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Ticketing</h5>
                    <p class="small">For international and domestic departure, e-tickets will be issued upon payment and completion of the booking process. In some instances, an e-ticket on the flights or fares selected may not be able to be issued. Bookings that cannot be issued as an e-ticket will have to be changed to comply with e-ticket regulations. All other travel documentation, such as hotel, car hire, transfer and tour vouchers will be emailed to you as an e-document. Should the Third-Party Travel Provider issue paper vouchers, these will be posted to you.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Special Needs</h5>
                    <p class="small">Travellers with a physical or mental disability that may require special assistance during their trip must advise us of their needs upon booking and declare all pre-existing medical conditions. This enables us to ensure the suitability of each booking to the individual traveller.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Bedding Configuration</h5>
                    <p class="small">Requests for specific bedding types must be made at the time of booking, however, cannot be guaranteed. Double rooms can be fitted with either double or twin beds. Single rooms are often smaller than other rooms. Triple rooms usually comprise a twin-bed room with an additional sofa bed, roll-away bed or fold-away bed for a third person.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Travelling With Children</h5>
                    <p class="small">Where a child stays for free in a room sharing with two paying adults, generally the hotel will expect the child to share the parent’s bed and will not provide an extra bed. Additional charges may be levied for child meals. Where a child rate is provided in this brochure, an extra roll or fold-away bed is usually provided. Children are charged an adult rate if staying in a room without adults.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">River Cruises – shore excursions & water levels</h5>
                    <p class="small">The nature of some shore excursions in Asia means that for some excursions there are no formal jetties. While staff are always on hand to assist, those with limited mobility may find these areas difficult to access. Due to the unpredictable nature of weather and its effect on river conditions and water levels, it may on occasions be necessary to complete some elements of the itinerary by land, rather than by boat, or to alter the route of the vessel including substituting some planned stops for others. Such changes can occur at any time without prior notice or warning and no refunds will be given in this instance. On the lower Mekong River between Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, large seasonal variations in water levels necessitate low-water and high-water itineraries. The only significant difference is a vehicle transfer to/from Siem Reap in place of cruising across Tonle Sap Lake. As a guide, low water itineraries are applied typically from January to early July, but this may vary depending on rainfall across the river catchments.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Complaint Handling</h5>
                    <p class="small">Travellers with a physical or mental disability that may require special assistance during their trip must advise us of their needs upon booking and declare all pre-existing medical conditions. This enables us to ensure the suitability of each booking to the individual traveller.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">Complaint Handling</h5>
                    <p class="small">In the unlikely event that you are unsatisfied with any aspect of your Travel Product, you must immediately notify the Third Party Travel Provider of your Travel Product or travel consultant (please refer to your pre-departure guide) to ensure we are given the opportunity to address and attempt to resolve any issue that you may raise at the time they occur. If a problem cannot be resolved to your satisfaction and you wish to pursue this matter further you must write to us within 28 days upon your return to the following address:</p>
