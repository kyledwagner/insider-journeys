We may use service providers to collect Session Data on our behalf. Unless you specifically inform us of your identity (e.g., by registering with us or making a booking through us), we will not know who you are.

                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">When you visit certain sections of our website, Google Analytics, a website analytics service provided by Google, Inc (“Google”), will place cookies on your computer’s browser. The information generated by the cookies about your use of our website is transmitted to Google. This information is then used for the purpose of compiling statistical reports to enable us to measure and analyse the number of visits to our website and its pages, the average time spent on the site and the pages viewed. We will not (and will not allow any third party to) use Google Analytics to track or to collect any personal data of visitors to our website. We will not associate any data gathered via use of cookies with any personal data from any source as part of our use of Google Analytics.

                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">STORAGE AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">We store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities, paper-based facilities and other records. If you have registered on our website, we store your personal information (and any personal information of individuals for whom you have made reservations) in databases, email servers, and third-party email marketing services. This includes storage of information (such as billing information) so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you book a product or service unless you tell us not to store it.</p>
                <p class="small pb-2">We will endeavour to take all reasonable precautions to maintain the security of the information in our systems. We use a combination of security measures to prevent the unauthorised access of our servers and regularly review our security policies. Your personal information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Insider Journeys, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers.</p>
                <p class="small pb-2">The payment pages on this website (if any) are encrypted using the internationally accepted security system SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt all credit card payments over the web. This means that the information from these pages are sent back to our server in a secure fashion and adequately protected against known interception schemes.</p>
                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>

                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">WHAT ABOUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION?</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">We will only collect your sensitive information with your consent and where it is desirable for your travel arrangements. We will only use and disclose your sensitive information for the primary purpose for which it was collected or a purpose that is directly related to this primary purpose and reasonably expected. Otherwise, we will not collect, use or disclose sensitive information about you unless required to do so by law.

                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER TRAVELLERS</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">If you provide us with information about other people travelling with you (for example, family members), you should make them aware of this Privacy Policy and any privacy collection notices we provide you.
                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">MARKETING AND PRIVACY</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">Serving customers well is very important to us. As part of this service, we may use your personal information to identify a product or service that you may be interested in. We may contact you from time to time to let you know about new or exciting products or services and special offers that may be of interest to you, including information about our business partners' products and services.</p>
                <h5 class="text-left">Opting-Out</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, including communications from us on behalf of our business partners, please contact our Privacy Officer using the details in the section titled 'CONTACT OUR PRIVACY OFFICER' section below, or for emails, use the unsubscribe facility.</p>
                <h5 class="text-left">Third Party Advertisers</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">We work with third parties to serve ads on our website and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use cookies and pixel tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our website with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share your personal information with our ad servers, media partners or ad networks without your authorisation.</p>
                <p class="small pb-2">We and the third-party advertisers use Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our website and on other sites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs, but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. You can opt-out of this kind of advertising by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. By opting out of this kind of advertising you may still receive ads from Insider Journeys or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p>
                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">MONITORING</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">We may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through our website, or through telephone or e-mail communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that we deem inappropriate or in violation of our terms and conditions. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.</p>
                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">LINKS AND SOCIAL PLUG-INS</h5>
                <p class="small pb-2">When you click on a third party's link from our website, or from an ad for a third party served by one of our service providers, you will enter that third party’s site, over which we have no control. We are not responsible for third party sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other sites you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to such other sites and may be very different from this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p class="small pb-2">Our website includes social plug-ins, such as the Facebook or Twitter button, and gives you the option to post information about your activities on our Site to your social media accounts. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social plug-ins are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
                <h5 class="text-left text-uppercase">PRIVACY COMPLAINTS</h5>
